Playing with bash
====================

Bash scripts
Most were written in 2013-2014 and rewritten in 2015.

Interesting things include:
- checking whether a new episode of the "Hello Internet" podcast has been released

- mass renaming files to substitute spaces with underscores, as well as changing encoding from windows-1251 to utf-8

- a simple logger
