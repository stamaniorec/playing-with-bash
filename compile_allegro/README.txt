Allegro is a C game development library.
Since compiling an Allegro game is a pain in the aRse and I kept losing those magic lines,
I decided to write a simple script to help me.

bash compile_allegro.sh game.c c
bash compile_allegro.sh game.cpp cpp

The first argument is the name of the file
The second argument determines whether gcc or g++ is to be used.
